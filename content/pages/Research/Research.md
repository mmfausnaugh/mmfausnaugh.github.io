I am an observatonal astronomer.  I mostly work on methods and data analysis in the [time domain]({filename}../time_domain_astronomy/time_domain_astronomy.md).

My main expertise is in [extragalactic astrophysics]({filename}../extragalactic/extragalactic.md), particularly Active Galactic Nuclei and Supernovae.

I also support the TESS mission at MIT and NASA Ames.  I am the Leader of the TESS Data Analysis Working Group (DAWG), which approves TESS data for release to the public archive. 

Read more about [my contributions for TESS]({filename}../TESS/TESS.md).

<!-- I also developed an [python package](https://github.com/mmfausnaugh/tica) to quickly calibrate TESS FFIs and [release them to the public (TICA, the TESS Image Calibrator)](https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/tica).
