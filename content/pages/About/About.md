I am an Assistant Professor at the [Texas Tech University Department of Physics and Astronomy ](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/phas/). I also have close ties to NASA's [Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)](https://tess.mit.edu/).

My [research interests]({filename}../Research/Research.md) focus on time domain astronomy and extragalactic astrophysics.
