slug: about

I am a researcher at the MIT Kavli Institute, working on the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).  I am especially interested in time domain astronomy and potential uses of TESS for extragalactic astrophysics.

I earned my PhD in Astronomy from the Ohio State University.
My thesis work was focused on the continuum emission in Active Galactic Nuclei.

I did my undergraduate work at St. John's College in Sante Fe, NM, which is known for its unique great books program.
