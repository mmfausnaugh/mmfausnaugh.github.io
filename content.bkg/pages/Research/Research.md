### Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)
I am working with the TESS mission to discover small exoplanets around nearby bright stars.  I will also use TESS to study extragalactic transient phenomena, such as supernovae, tidal disruption events, and exceptional AGN activity.

### Active Galactic Nuclei
I use the "reverberation mapping" technique to explore the interior structures of active galactic nuclei (AGN).

AGN are too distant to be resolved with direct imaging. Instead, I search for variable flux signals and their corresponding "light echoes"â€”the echoes encode information about the AGN interior. The videos below discuss this in more detail.

### Super Massive Black Hole Environments
The AGN phenomenon is interpreted as actively growing (accreting) super-massive black holes. My dissertation research was devoted to understanding the black hole's environment, in particular, the accretion flow and surrounding "broad line region."

### Cepheid Variables
My introduction to time-domain astronomy was a search for new Cepheid stars in NGC 4258, a mega-maser galaxy used to anchor the extra-galactic distance scale.

I am also working on a program to obtain precise Cepheid distances to the nearest AGN, which have distances uncertain by factors of 2 or more.
